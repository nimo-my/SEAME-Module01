# Main concepts of OOP

### ✅ 01. abstraction

### ✅ 02. encapsulation

- class (methods + variables) => encapsulation => abstraction
- In C++, encapsulation can be implemented using classes and access modifiers.
- We can not access any function from the class directly. We need an object to access that function that is using the member variables of that class. 
- The function which we are making inside the class must use only member variables, only then it is called encapsulation.
- Encapsulation improves readability, maintainability, and security by grouping data and methods together.
- It helps to control the modification of our data members. -> polymorphism & modularity

### ✅ 03. inheritance 
- public
- private
- protected (Base class : public -> protected)
- Base's public <- only Base class could access here.

### ✅ 04. polymorphism
- "having many forms"
- it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
- lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
they perform different tasks.

### ✅ 05. modularity
